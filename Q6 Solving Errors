  Here I am going to write the walkthrough for this question.

  Also, I will record something that might seem odd, hopefully
  I can figure out in the near future.


 STEP 1 :
 ==================
 1. CHANGE LAYOUTMANGER to LINEARLAYOUTMANGER
    @fragment_overview
    app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"

 2. WERID THINGS HAPPEN

  - after (1), the items within the RECYCLERVIEW became very small.
    I was expecting the items would be
                      [screen_width by 170dp]
    but the result is
                      [64dp by 64dp]

    So here are the things that I have tried but did not work :
    a .
      Wrap the image in a ConstraintLayout.
      The result is better. The image is showing the correct height.
      Unfortunately, it is not showing the proper width.

                        [170dp by 170dp]
    b.
      Wrap the Image in a RelativeLayout.
      Even though the Image did sized properly, but the TextViews are
      simply placed at the Center - horizonally.

  SOLUTION .
  STEP (1) is INCORRECT
        We still need to use GridLayoutManager
        We just need to set the span = 1

        Then we simply set the grid_view_item using ConstraintLayout.
